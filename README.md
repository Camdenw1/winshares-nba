# NBA Winshares stat

Note: I did this after taking on of my first classes in R so the code is pretty basic.

### Overview

Without any knowledge of how the winshares statistic was calculated, I wanted to investigate the statistic and see how I could predict it and what advanced statistics were most correlated. 

### Methods

I used linear models, anova tests, backwards AIC, backwards BIC, correlation plots, the vif function, and simple visualizations like histograms.
